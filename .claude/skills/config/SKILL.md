# Config

## Rules

- You MUST stick to the existing config structure and conventions.
- You MUST only call `config()` in the code, and you MUST NOT call `env()` outside of config files.
- You MUST put settings in a config file named for the domain it covers, in kebab-case
  (`config/docs.php`, `config/marketing.php`, `config/disposable-email.php`). There is no
  catch-all application config file, and you MUST NOT create one.
- You MUST document config values in `config/*.php` following Laravel's conventions: 3 lines of comments per value.
- You MUST document config values in `.env.example`.
